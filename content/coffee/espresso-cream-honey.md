## Description

A soothing drink for sore throats, or in general.

## Prep and Review

- In espresso cup, layer bottom with honey.  Sprinkle top of honey with cinnamon.
- Long pull of espresso into the cup.
- Mix well
- Finish with half and half. I keep cold to make something more refreshing, but could potentially use steamed milk or half and half for a heated version.

## Source/Story

Loosely based on the "Espresso and Cream" starbucks over-the-counter drink. Wanted a bit more flavor and nutritional value from a homemade drink.
