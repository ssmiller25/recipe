## Ingredients (1 Serving)
- 2 oz fresh espresso (double shot from your machine).
- 1-2 whole raw eggs (large, room temperature for easier blending).
- 1 tbsp sugar, pinch of salt.

## Instructions 
- Pull a fresh double espresso into a preheated cup.
- Whisk the yolks and sugar in a medium metal bowl to blend. Set the bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (do not allow the bottom of the bowl to touch the water). Whisk until the yolk mixture is very thick and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Whisk in the hot espresso. 
- Pour the espresso mixture into mugs and serve immediately.
