## Description

Enjoy K-Cup Hot Chocolate with an Espresso machine! This overall process should work with other K-Cup type coffee systems as well.

## Ingredients

- 4 oz Heavy Cream. Can substitute half and half, or whole milk if needed.
- 1 K-Cup

## Prep and Review

- Use a single-shot dual-walled basket in your espresso machine
- Manually open the lid and poor the contents into the basket. Tap as needed.
- Pull a single shot from the machine.
- Steam the heavy cream as usually.
- Stir hot chocolate with cream in an espresso cup. Enjoy!

**Note:** As hot chocolate is fairly powdery, it will not leave a clean puck to remove in the basket. The basket and all associated parts will need to be thoroughly cleaned.

## Source/Story

A gift of Keurig K-Cups left me in a bit of a quandary on how to brew them without a machine. This was a process I patched together from LLMs and the Internet.
