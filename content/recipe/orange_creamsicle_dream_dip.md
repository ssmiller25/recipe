## Ingredients

- **Cream Cheese:** Before starting this dip, let a block of cream cheese come to room temperature.
- **Whipped Topping:** Look for a container of whipped topping and let it thaw before using. Or, make homemade whipped topping!
- **Orange Gelatin:** I used 3 tablespoons of orange gelatin (like orange Jell-Oâ„¢) in this dip.
- **Mandarin Oranges:** Look for a can of Mandarin oranges. Canned mandarin oranges are peeled and segmented orange slices that are typically packed in syrup or juice. They are sweet, juicy, and ready to be used in recipes like this one! Before dicing the oranges and folding them in the dip, drain them first. Save a few whole ones for the topping.
- **Dippers**
  - Shortbread Cookies
  - Graham Crackers
  - Vanilla Wafers (These might be my favorite pairing.)
  - Fruit â€“ Sliced strawberries, apple slices, or pineapple chunks can add a fresh, fruity element.
  - Pretzels â€“ I like the salty contrast with the creamy dip.
  - Animal Crackers
  - A spoonðŸ˜œ! (Yes, it is so good, I could eat this dip with a spoon!)

## Instructions

1. Combine all ingredients
2. To store the orange creamsicle dip, place it in an airtight container and refrigerate it. It will stay fresh for up to 3 days. Be sure to keep it chilled until ready to serve. I do not recommend freezing the dip.
