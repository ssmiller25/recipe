## Ingredients

- 1 28oz Bottle Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue Sauce
- Buns or Mini-Buns

## Instructions

1. Mix shredded chicken and baby rays into crock pot. Mix thoroughly.

## Source/Story

On the fly recipe due to lack of pre-made options on 2025-03-22 game night. Ended up not bad, other then needing a bit  more barbecue sauce.
