Classic chewy chocolate chip cookies with crisp edges and soft centers.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp fine salt
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Heat oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment.
2. Cream butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy, 2-3 minutes.
3. Beat in eggs one at a time, then mix in vanilla.
4. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt in a separate bowl. Add to wet ingredients and mix just until combined.
5. Fold in chocolate chips.
6. Scoop 1 1/2 tbsp portions onto sheets, spacing 2 inches apart.
7. Bake 9-11 minutes until edges are golden and centers look set. Cool 5 minutes on the sheet, then transfer to a rack.

Basic, classic home-style chocolate chip cookies.

## Notes

- **Healthier swaps (optional):**
  - Replace 1/2 cup all-purpose flour with whole wheat flour for extra fiber.
  - Swap 1/4 cup of the butter with unsweetened applesauce to reduce saturated fat.
  - Reduce each sugar by 2 tbsp for a slightly less-sweet cookie.
  - Use dark chocolate chips or chopped dark chocolate for less sugar.
- Chill the dough 30 minutes for thicker cookies.
