Crispy and sweet air-fried apple wedges dusted with cinnamon sugar, served with a rich caramel whipped cream dipping sauce—an easy, delightful treat!

## Ingredients

- For the Apple Wedges:
    - 3 large apples (Honeycrisp or Granny Smith), sliced into wedges
    - 1 tablespoon melted butter
    - 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
    - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- For the Caramel Whipped Cream Dipping Sauce:
    - 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
    - 2 tablespoons caramel sauce
    - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
    - Optional: extra caramel drizzle

## Instructions

### Prepare the Apple Wedges:

1. Preheat your air fryer to 375°F (190°C). 
2. In a large bowl, toss the apple wedges with melted butter. 
3. In a small bowl, mix together sugar and cinnamon, then sprinkle over the apples, coating them evenly.
4. Arrange the apple wedges in a single layer in the air fryer basket. Air fry for 8–10 minutes, shaking the basket halfway, until the apples are tender and slightly crisp.


### Make the Caramel Whipped Cream Dipping Sauce:

1. In a mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Gently fold in the caramel sauce and vanilla extract until well combined.
2. Serve the warm apple wedges with the caramel whipped cream dipping sauce on the side, and drizzle extra caramel over the top if desired.
