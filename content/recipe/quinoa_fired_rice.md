## Ingredients

- 1 cup dry quinoa or brown rice
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 1 inch fresh ginger root, grated
- 2 carrots, peeled and sliced
- 2 bunches broccoli, cut into bite-sized florets
- 1 cup baby spinach
- 1/2 cup frozen peas
- 2 eggs
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- **Optional:** 8oz pre-cooked chicken breast.

## Instructions

1. Rinse 1 cup quinoa in a wire mesh strainer under cold water for about 10 seconds to remove bitterness.
2. Add quinoa and 2 cups water to a saucepan, bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes without stirring.
3. Remove from heat and let sit covered for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork and set aside (or refrigerate if making ahead).
4. Add frozen peas to a colander and run under warm water to defrost; drain well.
5. Heat 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat, then add 1–2 tbsp grated ginger and cook for 30 seconds, stirring.
6. Add sliced carrots with a pinch of salt and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute.
7. Add broccoli with another pinch of salt and cook until bright green and crisp-tender, adding a few tablespoons of water if the vegetables begin to stick or brown before tender.
8. Add spinach and peas, stirring until the spinach is wilted; transfer all vegetables to a large bowl.
9. Crack 2 eggs into a small bowl and whisk until combined (skip for vegan version).
10. Reduce skillet heat to low, add a small splash of oil if needed, then pour in the eggs and stir constantly to scramble until cooked through.
11. Return vegetables to the pan along with 1–2 cups cooked quinoa, stirring to heat everything through.
12. Remove from heat and stir in 2 tbsp soy sauce; taste and adjust seasoning, then serve immediately or portion into airtight containers for meals during the week.
13. **Optional:** Warm pre-cooked chicken breast, and add for additional protein.
