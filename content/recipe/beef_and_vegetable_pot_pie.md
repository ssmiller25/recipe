A delicious beef-based pot pie.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 lb ground beef
- 1/2 cup chopped onion
- 1 clove garlic, minced
- 1 1/2 Tbsp all-purpose flour
- 1/2 Tbsp Montreal steak seasoning
- 1/2 ( 15-oz) pkg frozen mixed vegetables
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1/2 cup heavy cream **or** Let's try 1 tablespoon of cornstarch in 1/2 cup of milk to replace.  [Saw this article that had a few other options too.](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/heavy-cream-substitutes#section3)
- 1 (7.5-oz) pkg buttermilk biscuit mix (Let's try just 1/2 of this to keep fat down…)


## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F. Cook beef, onion, and garlic in an ovenproof skillet over medium heat until beef is browned and crumbly; drain and return to skillet.
2. Add flour and steak seasoning; cook, stirring constantly, 2 minutes. Add vegetables, broth, and cream. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until thickened.
3.  Meanwhile, prepare biscuit dough according to package directions. Drop dough by heaping tablespoonfuls over beef mixture. Transfer skillet to oven, and bake 15 to 20 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown.
