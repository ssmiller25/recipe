You can either bake it in the oven, or cook it in a shallow pan on the stove top (I use the stove top method because it's faster and doesn't heat up a huge oven for a small pan)

Extra sharp cheddar (about half of a block) cut into medium-thick slices

White block cheese (I've used muesnter, colby jack, mozzarella, provolone but NOT Swiss unless you really like that specific flavor) (a little less than the amount of cheddar you use) cut into medium-thick slices

American cheese slices (about 5-6 slices)

White vinegar (about a 1/4 cup)

Water (about a 1/4 cup)

Mustard (about 3-4 tablespoons)  I've never measured this, I just squeeze a good amount over the top of the cheese & liquid.

The vinegar to water ratio can be adjusted to make it more "bitey".  I prefer to add a touch more vinegar in mine.  The combination of the two liquids should cover the bottom of the pan but not cover all of your cheese (it will be too liquidy).  If it looks too thin, add more cheese.

Cook over medium heat.  Stir frequently until all of the cheese is melted and it looks cottage cheesy in texture (sometimes removing it from the heat will help this process).  Remove from heat and let cool for a minute or two.  Serve over buttered toast.

## Source/Story

From the [Robbin's Family](https://robbinsgeneology.x10host.com/index.html) on Sarah's Pritchard branch of the family tree.

This is our great grandfather's (Alfred George Robbins) recipe from England.  Our great grandmother, his wife, Selma LeDuc Robbins modified the English version (known as Welsh Rarebit) by substituting vinegar for ale so it could be served to children.
