## Ingredients

For the Base:
  - 1/2 cup frozen pitaya (dragon fruit) chunks (look for pink dragon fruit for the color)
    - Or 10oz Pre-frozen dragon fruit smooth pouch kit
  - 1/2 cup frozen strawberries
  - 1/2 ripe banana (fresh or frozen)
  - 1/4 ripe avocado

For Sweetness & Creaminess:
  - 2 pitted Medjool dates (start with 2, add more if you prefer sweeter)
  - 1/2 tbsp sugar
  - 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk


## Instructions

**Prepare your ingredients:**

Soak the dates in warm water for 5-10 minutes. Then chop finely.
If using fresh banana, you can freeze it for a thicker, colder smoothie.

Combine ingredients in blender:

Add the unsweetened coconut milk and dates to your blender first. Blend them on high for a minute to try to get them completely integrated.
Then add the frozen pitahaya, frozen strawberries, banana, and avocado.

**Blend:**

Blend on high until completely smooth and creamy, about 2-3 minutes. If it's too thick, add a splash more coconut milk (a tablespoon at a time) until you reach your desired consistency. If it's too thin, add a few more frozen fruit chunks.

Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade "Let Me Love You" Smoothie!

**Tips & Variations:**

Sweetness: Adjust the number of dates to your preference. You can also add a tiny drizzle of maple syrup or agave if you need more sweetness.
Thickness: For a thicker smoothie bowl consistency, reduce the amount of coconut milk and add more frozen fruit.
Flavor Boosts: A tiny squeeze of lime juice can brighten the flavors.
Creaminess: The avocado and banana contribute significantly to the creaminess. Don't skip them!
