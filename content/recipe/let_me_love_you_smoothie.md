## Ingredients

For the Base:
  - 1/2 cup frozen pitaya (dragon fruit) chunks (look for pink dragon fruit for the color)
    - Or 10oz Pre-frozen dragon fruit smooth pouch kit
  - 1/2 cup frozen strawberries
  - 1/2 ripe banana (fresh or frozen)
  - 1/4 ripe avocado

For Sweetness & Creaminess:
  - 2-3 pitted Medjool dates (start with 2, add more if you prefer sweeter)
  - 1 cup unsweetened coconut milk
  
Optional Boosts (for similar benefits):
- 1 scoop collagen peptides (unflavored, any brand) - While the original specifies "Liposomal Collagen Peptide by Rho Nutrition," any unflavored collagen peptide will provide similar protein benefits. Liposomal refers to a delivery method for better absorption, which is hard to replicate at home.

For the "Coconut Beach Swirl" effect (optional, for flavor/presentation):
- 1-2 tablespoons full-fat canned coconut milk (refrigerated overnight for thick cream to separate) or coconut cream

## Instructions

Prepare your ingredients:

If using fresh banana, you can freeze it for a thicker, colder smoothie.
For the "Coconut Beach Swirl" effect: If you want a thick coconut swirl, refrigerate a can of full-fat coconut milk overnight. The cream will separate and solidify at the top. Scoop out 1-2 tablespoons of this thick cream.
Combine ingredients in blender:

Add the unsweetened coconut milk to your blender first.
Then add the frozen pitaya, frozen strawberries, banana, avocado, pitted dates, and collagen peptides (if using).
Blend:

Blend on high until completely smooth and creamy. If it's too thick, add a splash more coconut milk (a tablespoon at a time) until you reach your desired consistency. If it's too thin, add a few more frozen fruit chunks.
Assemble (optional "Coconut Beach Swirl"):

Pour about half of the smoothie into your serving glass.
Take the thick coconut cream (from the refrigerated can) and dollop a few spoonfuls into the glass, creating streaks or swirls. You can use a spoon or the back of a knife to gently swirl it up the sides of the glass if desired.
Pour the remaining smoothie into the glass.
You can add another dollop of coconut cream on top if you like.
Serve immediately and enjoy your homemade "Let Me Love You" Smoothie!

Tips & Variations:

Sweetness: Adjust the number of dates to your preference. You can also add a tiny drizzle of maple syrup or agave if you need more sweetness.
Thickness: For a thicker smoothie bowl consistency, reduce the amount of coconut milk and add more frozen fruit.
Flavor Boosts: A tiny squeeze of lime juice can brighten the flavors.
Protein Boost: If you don't have collagen peptides, you could add a scoop of vanilla protein powder for similar benefits.
Creaminess: The avocado and banana contribute significantly to the creaminess. Don't skip them!
