## Source/Story

An attempt to replicate one of our favorite chicken salad sandwich recipes from a campsite visited by the parents. Fed a basic description into Github Copilot as a basis.

Possible research idea: In "Salt, Fat, Acid, and Heat" book, look for a “bright cabbage slaw” recipe. I really think it’s some sort of acid I’m missing the the ingredients above
