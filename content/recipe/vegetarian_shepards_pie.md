A delicious Vegetarian Shepherd’s Pie, inspired by the Suvie cooking device recipe. Fresh mushrooms, carrots, cauliflower, and other hearty vegetables for the filling and creamy mashed potatoes as the topping make for a flavorful dish.

## Ingredients

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 shallot, minced
- 8 oz fresh mushrooms, sliced
- 6 oz cauliflower florets
- 2 carrots, peeled and chopped
- 3 tsp salt (divided)
- 1 tsp pepper, or to taste
- 2 tbsp cornstarch
- ¼ cup red wine (substitute with extra broth if desired)
- ½ cup vegetable stock
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 cup frozen peas
- ½ cup heavy cream
- 3 tbsp butter, melted
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 lb potatoes, peeled and cut into 1” cubes
- 1 tsp chopped chives

## Instructions


### Pre-prep

1. Preheat oven to **400°F**. 
2. Mince shallots
3. Cut up mushrooms, cauliflower, and carrots
4. Cut and peel potatoes

### Mashed Potato Topping


1. Place potatoes in a pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Simmer until potatoes are tender (10-15 minutes). Drain and return potatoes to the pot.
2. Add heavy cream, melted butter, garlic, and 1 tsp salt. Mash potatoes until smooth and creamy.
3. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.

### Vegetable Filling

1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
2. Add shallot, mushrooms, carrots, and cauliflower. Season with 2 tsp salt and pepper. Sauté until mushrooms release their moisture and veggies begin to brown (about 10 minutes).
3. In a small bowl, whisk cornstarch with 2 tbsp of red wine to create a slurry. Add remaining wine, vegetable stock, tomato paste, and peas; stir to combine.
4. Pour broth mixture over sautéed vegetables. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring, until the liquid thickens and coats the veggies.


### Assemble & Bake

1. Transfer vegetable filling to a greased oven-safe casserole dish. Spread mashed potatoes over the veggies, smoothing into an even layer.
2. Place casserole in preheated oven and bake uncovered for 15-20 minutes, until bubbly at the edges. For a golden top, broil for 5-7 minutes at the end.
3. Remove from oven, garnish with chopped chives, slice, and serve hot.

## Tips & Substitutions

- Substitute red wine with extra vegetable stock if desired.
- Potato starch can be used in place of cornstarch for thickening (may result in a slightly runnier filling).
- For extra flavor, add fresh rosemary or thyme during vegetable sauté.

This classic vegetarian shepherd’s pie matches the cozy comfort food style of Suvie recipes, using easy oven and stovetop methods for similar results.
