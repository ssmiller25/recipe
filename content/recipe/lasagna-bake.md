## Ingredients

- 1 lb penne pasta
- 1 (24 oz) jar marinara sauce
- 1 (15 oz) container ricotta cheese
- 2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1 egg
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp dried basil
- 1/2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/4 tsp dried thyme
- 1/4 tsp dried rosemary
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh basil for garnish (optional)

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.
2. Cook penne according to package directions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
3. In a large skillet, heat marinara sauce with garlic, basil, oregano, thyme, and rosemary over medium heat. Simmer for 5 minutes.
4. In a medium bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, 1 cup mozzarella, Parmesan, salt, and pepper.
5. Add cooked pasta to the marinara sauce and toss to combine. Fold in the ricotta mixture until evenly distributed.
6. Transfer everything to the prepared baking dish. Top with remaining 1 cup mozzarella cheese.

## Notes

This one-dish lasagna bake has all the flavors of traditional lasagna without the layering. Perfect for busy weeknights!

**Ricotta substitutions:** If you don't have ricotta, you can substitute with cottage cheese (drained), cream cheese mixed with a little milk, or a combination of Greek yogurt and cream cheese for a similar creamy texture.
