## Ingredients

- 1 lb pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 cup fresh blueberries (rinsed and dried)
- 4 oz goat cheese, crumbled
- 1 cup shredded low-moisture mozzarella (optional for melt and stretch)
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced (optional)
- 2 tbsp fresh basil, chiffonade
- 2 tsp lemon zest
- Pinch of kosher salt
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2–3 tbsp balsamic glaze (or reduced balsamic vinegar)
- Cornmeal or flour for the peel

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C). If using a pizza stone or steel, place it in the oven while it preheats (at least 30 minutes).
2. On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll the dough to a 12–14 inch round. Transfer to a parchment sheet or a cornmeal-dusted peel.
3. Brush the dough lightly with olive oil. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and a few grinds of pepper.
4. Scatter mozzarella (if using) evenly over the dough. Distribute crumbled goat cheese in small dollops.
5. Add blueberries and sliced red onion (if using). Sprinkle lemon zest across the top.
6. Bake until the crust is deeply golden and the cheese is melty, about 8–12 minutes depending on oven and stone.
7. Remove from the oven. Drizzle balsamic glaze over the pizza and finish with fresh basil.
8. Slice and serve immediately.

**Tips & Variations:**

- **Balsamic:** Use a thick balsamic glaze for best contrast with tart blueberries. If reducing vinegar at home, simmer 1/2 cup balsamic until syrupy (5–8 minutes), cool before drizzling.
- **Sweetness:** For a sweeter profile, toss blueberries with 1/2 tsp sugar before topping.
- **Crunch:** Add toasted walnuts or pecans after baking for texture.
- **Savory boost:** A few thin prosciutto ribbons after baking add a salty counterpoint (non-vegetarian).
- **Herbs:** Mint pairs nicely with basil for a fresh finish.

Sarah's idea a few days ago. Used Github copilot to author. AI inspiration was summer farmer’s market flavors: tangy goat cheese, sweet-tart blueberries, and a balsamic finish on a crisp crust.
