## Instructions

### Prepare the Cheeseburger Filling

1. In a skillet, cook the ground beef over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat.
2. Add the chopped onion, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, mustard, salt, and pepper. Stir and cook for another 2 minutes. Set aside to cool.

### Prepare the Garlic Parmesan Butter

1. In a small bowl, mix together the melted butter, Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, chopped parsley, olive oil, and salt. Stir well and set aside.


### Assemble the Bombs

1. Slice the slider buns or dinner rolls in half, keeping them attached.
2. Place a spoonful of the cooled cheeseburger filling onto the bottom half of each bun.
3. Sprinkle the shredded cheese on top of the filling.
4. Place the top half of the bun on top and gently press down.

### Bake the Bombs

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. Place the assembled buns in a baking dish and brush the garlic Parmesan butter over the top of each bun.
3. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the buns are golden brown and the cheese has melted.
