## Ingredients

- 2 Scallions
- 1 Tomato
- 2 Eggs
- 1/2 Cup Mexican Cheese Blend
- 2 Brioche Buns
- 2 Tbsp Mayonnaise
- 4 Tbsp Guacamole
- 1.5 oz Blue Corn Tortilla Chips

## Instructions

1. Wash and dry produce.
2. Trim and thinly slice half the scallions (all for 4 servings). Slice tomato into 1/4-inch-thick rounds.
3. Crack each egg into a separate small microwave-safe bowl. Divide sliced scallions between bowls; gently pierce yolks with a fork, then stir once. Cover bowls with plastic wrap and microwave until eggs are cooked through, 1-2 minutes. Immediately uncover bowls and top eggs with Mexican cheese blend; set aside until ready to serve.
4. While eggs cook, halve and toast buns.
5. Spread top buns with guacamole. Spread bottom buns with mayo. Fill buns with cheesy eggs, tomato, and a few tortilla chips.
6. Divide sandwiches
