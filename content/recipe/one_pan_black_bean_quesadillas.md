2. Place 2-4 oz. Of dried chilis in a small pot just covered in water, bring to a boil, than let simmer until soft. 15 to 20 min.
3. Dice onion and place in a food processor or blender. Add soften chilis (drained), and can of fire roasted tomatoes (drained). Blend until smooth.
4. Place puree on stove, add the rest of your wet ingredients.
5. Add all of the dry ingredients to the pot.
6. Bring to a simmer and stir for about 15 minutes, it will become really fragrant. The rest is up to you on how you want to store it!! This turned out amazing for me!

### Best Tips:

Use Penzeys chili 9000 chili powder. You wont regret it.

Use an icecube tray to make easy portions, the ice cube tray i used is about 2 tbsp per cube ðŸ™‚.

This makes about 3 of the icecube tray fulls pictured. I would cut the recipe in half if you are looking for less. Once everything is frozen i keep them in a ziplock freezerbag for later use!
