## Ingredients

- 2 cans of cinnamon rolls, cut into quarters
- 2 oz milk
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tbsp cinnamon

1. Prep the Cinnamon Rolls: Cut the cinnamon rolls into quarters.
2. Make the Soaking Mixture: In a bowl, mix together the milk, vanilla extract, and cinnamon.
3. Soak the Cinnamon Rolls: Toss the quartered cinnamon roll pieces in the milk mixture. Let them soak for about 10-15 minutes to absorb the flavors.

5. Bake the Casserole: 
   - Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
   - Pour the soaked cinnamon roll pieces into a baking dish.
   - Pour the microwaved icing over the top of the cinnamon roll pieces.
6. Bake: Bake in the preheated oven for 20-25 minutes, or until the casserole is golden brown and cooked through.
7. Serve: Serve warm and enjoy!
