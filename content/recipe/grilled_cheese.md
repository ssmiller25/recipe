A wonderfully simple recipe, great for introducing the kids to cooking (with adult supervision of course!)

## Ingredients

- White Bread
- Cheese [^1]
- Butter

## Instructions

1. Butter one side of bread
   1. Alternatively, can just slice 2 - 1 Tablespoon slabs and melt in pan right before cooking
2. Place cheese between two slices of bread
3. In pan over medium heat, fry each side until golden brown
4. Serve and enjoy!

## Source/Story

The grilled cheese I grew up on!  Although the adult versions are from recipe variations I've come across from.

## Notes

[^1]: For kids, american cheese.  For adults, I prefer a combination of shredded cheddar and shredded Monterey Jack
