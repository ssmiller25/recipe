Ingredients

- 8 tablespoons (1 stick) salted butter
- 1 cup plus 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter, divided
- 9 graham crackers sheets (about 4 ounces)
- 2 cups powdered sugar
- 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
- Flaky salt, such as Maldon (optional)


Instructions

1. Line the bottom and two opposite sides of an 8x8-inch or 9x9-inch baking pan with a sheet of parchment paper long enough so that it hangs off the sides to form a sling.
2. Place 1 stick salted butter in a large microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on HIGH until melted, 40 to 60 seconds. Add 1 cup of the creamy peanut butter and stir to combine. Add 2 cups powdered sugar and stir until combined.
3. Place 9 graham cracker sheets in a gallon-size zip-top bag. Use a rolling pin to crush the crackers into fine crumbs (about 1 1/4 cups). Add the crumbs to the peanut butter mixture and stir to combine. Transfer to the baking pan and press into an even layer.
4. Wipe out the bowl. Place 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chip and the remaining 2 tablespoons creamy peanut butter in the bowl and microwave on HIGH, stirring halfway through, until the chocolate chips are softened enough to melt completely in the residual heat, about 40 seconds total. Spread evenly over the bars. Sprinkle with flaky salt if desired.
5. Refrigerate until firm, about 2 hours. Grasping the excess parchment paper, lift the peanut butter bar slab out of the pan onto a cutting board. Cut into 16 bars.
