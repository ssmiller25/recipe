Cucumber adds refreshing crunch to the creamy tuna salad in this sandwich. We opted for strained yogurt to reduce the saturated fat and give the dressing some tanginess. Add some relish, chopped celery or pickled peppers to the tuna mixture to boost the flavor even more. Serve with potato chips, chopped fresh veggies or bagel chips on the side.

## Ingredients

- 1 (5 ounce) can no-salt-added solid white tuna in water, drained
- 3 tablespoons reduced-fat plain strained yogurt
- 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped shallot
- 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh chives
- 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon ground pepper
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 2 slices whole-wheat bread
- 1/2 cup thinly sliced Persian cucumbers

## Instructions

1. Stir tuna, yogurt, oil, lemon juice, shallot, chives, dill, garlic powder, pepper and salt together in a small bowl until well blended.
2. Spread the tuna mixture on 1 side of each bread slice.
3. Arrange cucumber slices on 1 slice; top with the remaining slice. Cut the sandwich in half diagonally before serving.
