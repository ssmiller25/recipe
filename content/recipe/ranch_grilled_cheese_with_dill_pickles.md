## Ingredients

- 4 Pieces sourdough bread
- Dill pickle slices
- 2 oz Cream Cheese
- 2 oz Shredded Monterey Jack Cheese
- 1.5 oz Buttermilk Ranch Dressing

## Instructions

1. Pat pickles dry with a paper towel.
2. Place cream cheese in a microwave-safe bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave until softened, 20-30 seconds. Add dressing and shredded cheese and stir to combine.
3. Spread bread with cheese mixture; place on a clean work surface, cheese sides up. Top with as many pickles as youâ€™d like. Top with remaining bread, cheese sides down.
4. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium heat. Add sandwiches and cook until bread is golden and cheese has melted slightly, 2-3 minutes per side. (Work in batches if necessary.)
5. Halve and serve.
