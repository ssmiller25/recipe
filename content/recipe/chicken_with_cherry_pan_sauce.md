A delicious compo of a sweet and savory sauce with pan seared chicken, mashed potatoes, and roasted green beans.

## Ingredients

- 12oz Potatoes
- 4oz Bacon
- 6oz Green Beans
- 2 Scallions
- 1.5 tbsp Sour Cream
- 10oz Chicken Cutlets
- 1 pkg Cherry Jam

## Instructions

1. Make Mashed Potatoes
    -  Adjust racks to top and middle positions and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce.
    - Dice potatoes into 1/2-inch pieces. Place in a medium pot with enough salted water to cover by 2 inches. Bring to a boil and cook until tender, 15-20 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup potato cooking liquid, then drain.
    - Return potatoes to pot and mash until smooth and creamy, adding splashes of reserved potato cooking liquid as needed. Cover to keep warm. (Youâ€™ll finish the potatoes in Step 6.)
2. Cook Bacon and Prep
    - Place bacon on a plate in paper towel.  Microwave 3-5 minutes until fully cooked
    - Meanwhile, trim green benas if necessary.  Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from the greens.

    - Toss asparagus on empty side of sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast on middle rack until chicken is cooked through and green beans are tender and lightly browned, 12-15 minutes.
4. Finish Potatoes
    - To pot with potatoes, add sour cream and 2 Tbsp butter.  Mash until smooth and creamy, adding splaces of reserved potato cooking liquid as needed
    - Fold in half the bacon and half the scallion greens.  Taste and season with salt and pepper.  Cover to keep warn.
5. Make Sauce
    - Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for chicken over medium heat. Add scallion whites and cook, stirring, until softened and fragrant, 1 minute. 
    - Stir in 1/4 cup water, jam, and stock concentrate. Cook, stirring, until thickened, 2-3 minutes. Remove pan from heat; stir in sour cream and 1 Tbsp butter. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Finish and Serve
    - Slice chicken crosswise.
    - Divide chicken, green beans, and mashed potatoes between plates. Spoon sauce over chicken and sprinkle potatoes with remaining bacon and remaining scallion greens. Serve.
