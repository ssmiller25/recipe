Our favorite banana bread recipe.  A bit sticky, but really great warmed up with a bit of butter.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 3/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup butter, softened
- 2 large eggs
- 1 1/2 cups mashed ripe banana (about 3 bananas)
- 1/3 cup plain low-fat yogurt
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- Cooking spray

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°.
1. Place sugar and butter in a large bowl, and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Add the eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Add banana, yogurt, and vanilla; beat until blended. 
1. Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt, into a sifter or mesh strainer. Sift flour mixture over mix.  Mix by hand until just moist.  Spoon batter into an 8 1/2 x 4 1/2-inch loaf pan coated with cooking spray.
1. Bake at 350° for 1 hour or until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes in pan on a wire rack; remove from pan. Cool completely on wire rack.
1. For mini-loaf pans, back for 40-45 minutes.
