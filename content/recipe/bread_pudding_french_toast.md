## Ingredients

- 1 loaf (about 1 pound) day-old brioche or challah bread, cut into 1-inch thick slices
- 6 large eggs
- 1½ cups whole milk
- ½ cup heavy cream
- ⅓ cup granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ¼ teaspoon salt
- 4 tablespoons butter, for cooking
- Maple syrup, for serving
- Fresh berries and powdered sugar, for garnish (optional) [^1]

## Instructions

1. Prepare the custard mixture
   1. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, heavy cream, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt until well combined
   2. Arrange bread slices in a single layer in a 9x13 baking dish
   3. Pour custard mixture evenly over bread slices
   4. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight (at least 8 hours) [^2]

2. Cook the french toast
   1. Remove soaked bread from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking
   2. Preheat a large non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat
   3. Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in the pan
   4. Carefully transfer 2-3 soaked bread slices to the pan (they'll be very soft)
   5. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and crisp on the outside but still custardy inside
   6. Repeat with remaining slices, adding more butter as needed

3. Serve immediately
   1. Transfer to plates
   2. Drizzle with maple syrup
   3. Garnish with powdered sugar and fresh berries if desired

## Source/Story

This recipe combines the best of both worlds: the custardy richness of bread pudding with the crispy, caramelized exterior of french toast. It's perfect for holiday mornings or weekend brunches when you want something special but don't want to spend too much time in the kitchen. The overnight prep makes morning cooking quick and easy!
