## Ingredients

- 12 oz Potatoes
- 9 oz Carrots
- 1/4 Cup Panko Breadcrumbs
- 1 Tbsp Beef Stock Concentrate
- 10 oz Ground Beef
- 1/2 cup Cheddar Cheese
- 2 Tbsp Katchup
- 2 Tbsp Mayonnaise

## Instructions

1. Prep

    - Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce.
   
    - Cut potatoes into 1/2-inch-thick wedges. Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal into 1/4-inch-thick pieces. Halve, peel, and thinly slice shallot.

2. Roast Potatos
    
    - Toss potatoes on one side of a baking sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper (for 4 servings, spread out across entire sheet).
    - Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (you’ll add more to the sheet then).

3. Form Meatloaves

    - Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, soak panko with 1 TBSP water  and stock concentrate until liquid has absorbed. Add beef, 1/2 tsp salt, and pepper; mix to combine.
    - Form beef mixture into two 1/2-inch-thick rounds. Reserve half the cheddar for topping; divide remaining cheddar between the centers of each round. Gently fold meat around cheese, shaping and sealing to create 1-inch-thick loaves.

4. Bake Meatloaves

    - Once potatoes have roasted 5 minutes, remove sheet from oven. Add meatloaves to opposite side of sheet. 
    - Roast on top rack until potatoes are browned and tender and meatloaves are cooked through, 17-20 minutes more.
    - In the last 2 minutes of roasting, top meatloaves with reserved cheddar. Return to oven until cheese melts.

5. Cook Carrots

    - Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, heavy- bottomed pan over medium-high heat. Add carrots and a pinch of salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned and softened, 5-7 minutes. TIP: If carrots begin to brown too quickly, add a few splashes of water.
    - Turn off heat; transfer carrots to a plate. Wipe out pan.

6. Make Sauce

    - In a separate small bowl, combine ketchup and mayonnaise. Stir in water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches a drizzling consistency. Season with salt and pepper.

7. Finish and Serve

    - Slice meatloaves crosswise if desired.
    - Divide meatloaves, potato wedges, and carrots between plates. Drizzle meatloaves with some of the special sauce. Serve remaining sauce on the side with potatoes for dipping.
