## Ingredients

- 12 oz Potatoes
- 1 Shallot
- 9 oz Carrots
- 1 Tbsp Flour
- 1/4 Cup Panko Breadcrumbs
- 1 Beef Stock Concentrate (about 1 oz?)
- 10 oz Ground Beef
- 1/2 cup Cheddar Cheese
- 2 Tbsp Katchup
- 2 Tbsp Mayonnaise

## Instructions

1 PREP
• Adjust rack to top position (top and middle
positions for 4 servings) and preheat oven
to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce.
• Cut potatoes into 1⁄2-inch-thick wedges.
Trim, peel, and cut carrots on a diagonal
into 1⁄4-inch-thick pieces. Halve, peel, and
thinly slice shallot.

2 ROAST POTATOES
• Toss potatoes on one side of a baking
sheet with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and
pepper (for 4 servings, spread out across
entire sheet).
• Roast on top rack for 5 minutes (you’ll add
more to the sheet then).

3 FORM MEATLOAVES
• Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, soak panko
with 1 TBSP water (2 TBSP for 4 servings)
and stock concentrate until liquid has
absorbed. Add beef*, 1⁄2 tsp salt (1 tsp for 4),
and pepper; mix to combine.
• Form beef mixture into two 1⁄2-inch-thick
rounds (four rounds for 4). Reserve half
the cheddar for topping; divide remaining
cheddar between the centers of each round.
Gently fold meat around cheese, shaping
and sealing to create 1-inch-thick loaves.

4 BAKE MEATLOAVES
• Once potatoes have roasted 5 minutes,
remove sheet from oven. Add meatloaves
to opposite side of sheet. (For 4 servings,
leave potatoes roasting; add meatloaves to
a second sheet and roast on middle rack.)
• Roast on top rack until potatoes are
browned and tender and meatloaves are
cooked through, 17-20 minutes more.
• In the last 2 minutes of roasting, top
meatloaves with reserved cheddar. Return
to oven until cheese melts.

5 COOK CARROTS

• Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, heavy-
bottomed pan over medium-high heat.

Add carrots and a pinch of salt and
pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until
browned and softened, 5-7 minutes. TIP: If
carrots begin to brown too quickly, add a
few splashes of water.
• Turn off heat; transfer carrots to a plate.
Wipe out pan.

6 FRY SHALLOT & MAKE SAUCE
• In a small bowl, toss shallot with flour and
a pinch of salt and pepper.
• In pan used for carrots, heat a 1⁄3-inch layer
of oil over medium heat. Once oil is
hot enough that a pinch of flour sizzles
immediately when added to the pan, add
coated shallot. Cook, stirring occasionally,
until golden brown, 3-5 minutes.
• Using a slotted spoon, transfer shallot to a
paper-towel-lined plate.
• Meanwhile, in a separate small bowl,
combine ketchup and mayonnaise. Stir in
water 1 tsp at a time until mixture reaches
a drizzling consistency. Season with salt
and pepper.

7 FINISH & SERVE
• Slice meatloaves crosswise if desired.
• Divide meatloaves, potato wedges, and
carrots between plates. Drizzle meatloaves
with some of the special sauce. Serve
remaining sauce on the side with potatoes
for dipping. Garnish meatloaves with crispy
shallot and serve.
