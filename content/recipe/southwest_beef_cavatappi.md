## Ingredients

- 1 Long Green Pepper
- 1 lb. Ground Beef
- 2 Tbsp Beef Stock Concentrate
- 1/2 Cup Mexican Cheese Blend
- 2 Scallions 
- 6 oz. Cavatappi Pasta
- 1 Tbsp [Southwest Spice Blend](/recipe/spice_blends) 
- 1.5 oz Tomato Paste
- 1.5 Tbsp Sour Cream
- 4 Tbsp Smoky Red Pepper Crema

## Instructions

1. Prep
    - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce.
    - Halve, deseed, and thinly slice green pepper into strips. Trim and thinly slice scallions, separating whites from greens.
2. Cook Pasta and Pepper
    - Once water is boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes.
    - Reserve 1 cup pasta cooking water, then drain.
    - Meanwhile, heat a large drizzle of oil in a medium pan over medium-high heat. Add green pepper and season with salt and pepper; cook, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, 4-5 minutes.
3. Cook Beef
    - Add a drizzle of oil to pan with green pepper. Add beef, scallion whites, and Southwest Spice Blend; season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until beef is browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Drain excess greese from pan.
    - Add tomato paste; cook, stirring occasionally, until combined, 30 seconds.
4. Cook Sauce
    - Add 1/2 cup reserved pasta cooking water and stock concentrates to pan with beef mixture. Season with 1/2 tsp salt and a pinch of pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring, until thickened, 2-3 minutes.
5. Finish Pasta
    - Reduce heat to low and stir in drained cavatappi, sour cream, smoky red pepper crema, half the Mexican cheese blend (youâ€™ll use the rest in the next step), and 1 Tbsp butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste. If needed, stir in more reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until pasta is coated in a creamy sauce.
