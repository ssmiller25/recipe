## Ingredients

- 1 Can of Tuna
- Celery
- Red Onion
- Mayonnaise
- Dijon Mustard
- Lemon Juice
- Opt
  - Parsley

## Instructions

1. Drain the tuna water, flake it with a fork, and put it into a medium-size bowl. Chop the celery and red onion into small dice and add them to the tuna mixture.

2. Add a few dollops of mayonnaise and a spoonful of Dijon mustard into the tuna and combine. Then, mix in the chopped parsley, a spritz of lemon juice, and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.

3. Put the tuna salad on one piece of the sliced whole wheat bread, then layer cheddar cheese on the other half. Heat a skillet on medium-high heat and melt butter in it. Then grill your sandwich on both sides until the bread begins to brown and the cheese melts. Cut it in half and serve.
