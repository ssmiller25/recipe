A classic Canadian no-bake layered bar with a chocolate-coconut base, custard buttercream center, and glossy chocolate top.

## Ingredients

- **Base**
  - 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
  - 1/4 cup granulated sugar
  - 5 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder
  - 1 large egg, lightly beaten
  - 1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
  - 1 cup shredded coconut (sweetened or unsweetened)
  - 1/2 cup finely chopped nuts (almonds or walnuts)
- **Custard filling**
  - 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened
  - 2 tbsp custard powder
  - 2 cups powdered sugar
  - 2 tbsp milk
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
- **Chocolate topping**
  - 4 oz semisweet chocolate, chopped
  - 2 tbsp unsalted butter

## Instructions

1. Line an 8x8-inch pan with parchment, leaving overhang for lifting.
2. For the base, whisk melted butter, sugar, and cocoa in a heatproof bowl. Set over a saucepan of barely simmering water and whisk in the egg until slightly thickened, 1-2 minutes.
3. Remove from heat and stir in graham crumbs, coconut, and nuts. Press firmly into the pan. Chill 15 minutes.
4. For the filling, beat butter until smooth. Beat in custard powder, then alternate powdered sugar and milk until light and spreadable. Mix in vanilla.
5. Spread filling over chilled base. Chill 20 minutes.
6. For topping, melt chocolate with butter over low heat (or in short microwave bursts), stirring until smooth. Pour and tilt to cover evenly.
7. Chill until set, about 30-45 minutes. Lift out and cut into small bars, wiping the knife between cuts.

## Source/Story

Inspired by the traditional Nanaimo Bar described on Wikipedia.

## Notes

- For clean slices, score the chocolate layer after 10 minutes of chilling, then cut fully once set.
- Swap nuts for more coconut if you want a nut-free version.
