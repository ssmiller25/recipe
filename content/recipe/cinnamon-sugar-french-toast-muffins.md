## Instructions

### Prepare Muffin Batter

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.

4. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.

### Cook the Muffins

1. Divide batter evenly among muffin cups.
2. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
3. Allow muffins to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
4. Cinnamon Sugar Coating:
5. In a shallow dish, mix together 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon.
6. While muffins are still warm, dip tops into the cinnamon sugar mixture, pressing gently to adhere.

### Make it Crispy

1. For a crispy top, bake muffins for an additional 2-3 minutes. Keep an eye on them to avoid overcooking.
