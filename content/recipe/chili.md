    - Once chili is ready to serve, dice tomato into 1/2-inch pieces. 
    - Serve chili, scallion greens, tomato, red pepper crema, and cheddar family style and let everyone build their own chili bowl!


## Old Recipe

### Ingredients

- Coconut oil or olive oil, 2 Tbsp
- Onion, 1 large, diced
- Garlic, 1 clove, minced  
- Lean ground beef, 2 pound (4 pounds if not using beans)
- Cumin, 2 Tbsp
- Chili powder, 2 Tbsp
- Salt
- Pepper
- Tomato paste, 2 6 oz can
- Beans, 4 15-oz cans (pinto, black beans, kidney - choose one or combine for more variety of texture) 
- Diced fire-roasted tomatoes, 2 14 oz can
- Beef broth or water, 2 14 oz can (or 3.5 cups)
- Garnish options:  fresh lime, cilantro, avocado, sour cream, jalapenos

### Prep

- Dice Onions
- Mince Garlic


### Instructions

1. Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.  
1. Add the onion and cook, stirring everything 30 seconds or so, until softened, about 5-7 minutes.
1. Add the minced garlic and cook 1 minute.  
1. Add beef and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it's just cooked through, about 5 minutes.
1. Add the spices: cumin, chili powder, a pinch of salt, and a couple of grinds of pepper. Stir well and cook until fragrant.
1. Add tomato paste and stir for 1 minute.  
1. Add 1 can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of beef broth (or veggie broth or water), and the beans (if using).  
1. Bring to a boil.
1. Turn heat to low and let it simmer, meaning it's barely bubbling, for 1-2 hours to let the flavors meld. The longer it simmers, the deeper the flavors. 
1. Take off heat and serve or divide up into individual containers (only fill them 80% of the way) and store in the refrigerator until you're ready to enjoy.  If you want them to last longer than 4 days, move to the freezer only after they have cooled down in the refrigerator. Hot food in the freezer is what creates slow, uneven freezing and creates those gross ice crystals on your food!

## Source/Story

Original was something I wipped together from various sources, as well as experimentation.

11/17/2018 Experiment: Use crock pot for main cooking.  1-6 in Sause Pan, the 7+ in crock pot on high until boil, then low for 2-3 hours (or more…)
