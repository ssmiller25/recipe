## Ingredients

- 1/4 cup pure olive oil
- 6 pounds meaty beef short ribs on the bone. Potentially could replace with other meat cuts, such as Top Sirloin Steak [^1]
- Salt and freshly ground pepper
- freshly ground pepper
- 2 celery ribs, coarsely chopped
- 1 carrot, coarsely chopped
- 1 large onion,coarsely chopped
- 1/2 cup tomato paste
- 5 thyme sprigs
- 3 anchovy fillets, chopped [^2]
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 head of garlic, halved crosswise
- 1 quart chicken stock or canned low-sodium broth
- 2 cups dry red wine
- 1/3 cup white vinegar [^4]

## Instructions

1. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large enameled cast-iron casserole. Season the ribs with salt and pepper. Add half of the short ribs to the casserole and cook over moderately high heat until browned, about 6 minutes. Transfer the ribs to a plate. Repeat with the remaining oil and ribs.
2. Add the celery, carrot, and onion to the casserole and cook over moderate heat until softened, about 7 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook, stirring, until glossy, about 2 minutes. Add the thyme sprigs, anchovies, bay leaf, and garlic and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the stock, wine, and vinegar and bring to a boil. Return the short ribs to the casserole, then cover them and braise in the oven until the meat is very tender, about 3 hours.
3. Transfer the ribs to a platter. Strain the braising liquid, pressing hard on the solids; skim the fat. [^3] Season with salt and pepper. Serve half of the ribs with some of the sauce. Reserve the rest in the remaining sauce for sandwiches.

## Notes

[^1]: Pat the ribs dry before seasoning and searing in batches to ensure they brown nicely.
[^2]: Don't be tempted to skip the anchovies — they'll melt into the dish to add umami without any fishiness. Potentially replace with Worshishire sauce. 
[^3]: If making ahead, you can strain the braising liquid as directed in Step 3, then chill the ribs in the sauce, removing the hardened fat before reheating and seasoning to taste.
[^4]: Do NOT be tempted to use red wine vinegar as a cheat. The vinegar ratio ends up being too high. Need to directly control the ratio of red wine to vinegar directly.
