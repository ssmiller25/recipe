## Ingredients

- 1 Red Onion
- 4oz Pineapple
- 5 tsp Red Wine Vinegar
- 1 Long Green Pepper
- 4 oz Fresh Mozzarella
- 1/4 oz Cilantro
- 2 Flatbreads
- 4 Tbsp BBQ Sause
- 1/4 Cup Monterey Jack Cheese


## Instructions

1. Start Prep and Pickle Onion
    - Place a foil-lined baking sheet on top rack and preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash and dry produce.
    - Halve, peel, and thinly slice onion. Drain pineapple over a small bowl, reserving juice. Stir 1/4 of the onion, half the vinegar (youâ€™ll use the rest later), and a pinch of salt into bowl with juice. Set aside.
2. Cook Onion
    - Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add remaining onion; cook, stirring and adding splashes of water as needed to prevent sticking, until softened, 6-8 minutes.
3. Finish Prep
    - While onion cooks, halve, core, and very thinly slice green pepper into strips. Toss in a second small bowl with a drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper. Dice mozzarella into 1/2-inch pieces. Finely chop cilantro.
4. Caramelize
    - Once cooked onion is softened, increase heat under pan to medium high. Add pineapple and a drizzle of oil; cook, stirring, until pineapple is lightly browned, 2-3 minutes.
    - Stir in remaining vinegar. Cook, stirring, until onion and pineapple are caramelized and jammy, 1-2 minutes more. Turn off heat and season with salt and pepper.
5. Assemble Flatbreads
    - Brush or rub each flatbread with a drizzle of oil. Carefully remove prepared baking sheet from oven; place flatbreads on sheet.
    - Evenly spread flatbreads with BBQ sauce, then top with caramelized onion and pineapple, green pepper,
6. Finish and Serve
    - Return flatbreads to top rack until cheese melts and edges are golden brown, 10-12 minutes.
    - Transfer flatbreads to a cutting board and top with cilantro and pickled onion (draining first) to taste. Cut into pieces, divide between plates, and serve.
