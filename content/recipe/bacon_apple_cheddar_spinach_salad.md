## Ingredients

- 1 Granny Smith Apple
- 4 oz Bacon
- 5 oz Spinach
- 1/2 Cup White Cheddar
- 1 oz Dried Cranberries
- 1/2 oz Walnuts
- 3 oz Honey Dijon Dressing

## Instructions

1. Wash and dry produce.
2. Halve, core, and thinly slice apple.
3. Heat a medium dry nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Using kitchen shears, cut bacon into bite-size pieces directly into pan. Cook, stirring occasionally and adjusting heat if browning too quickly, until crispy, 4-6 minutes.
4. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper-towel-lined plate.
5. In a large bowl, combine spinach, apple, bacon, half the cheddar, half the cranberries, and half the walnuts.
6. Add as much dressing as you like and toss to combine. Season lightly with salt and pepper to taste.
7. Divide salad between shallow bowls. Top with remaining cheddar, remaining cranberries, and remaining walnuts. Serve.
