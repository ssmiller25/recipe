## Ingredients

- 1 cup cook rice
- 1 egg
- 1 carrot
- 3-4 tbls soy sauce
- Sesame Oil

## Instructions

1. Cook Rice
2. Cool Rice Safely
   1. After cooking your rice, spread it evenly on a clean shallow tray or plate to cool it quickly. 
   2. Optionally, place the tray in a cold water bath to hasten cooling or fan the rice while spreading it out to release steam.
   3. Once cooled to near room temperature (preferably within 1 hour), cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
   4. Use this cooled rice to make your fried rice, which helps prevent mushiness and reduces the risk of bacterial growth.
3. Scramble 2 eggs in a pan with some butter or oil, then set aside.
4. Saut√© diced carrots, in butter or oil until tender (about 5 minutes).
5. Add the rice, scrambled eggs and soy sauce; stir and fry for 3-5 minutes, letting the rice crisp up a bit.
6. Finish with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil, adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or extra soy sauce.
7. Serve hot immediately
