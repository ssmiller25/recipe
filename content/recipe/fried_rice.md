## Ingredients

- 1 cup uncooked white rice (jasmine or long-grain work best)
- 1 1/2 cups water
- 1 egg
- 1 carrot
- 3-4 tbls soy sauce
- Sesame Oil

## Instructions

1. **Cook the Rice:**
   1. Rinse 1 cup of rice in cold water until the water runs clear (this removes excess starch).
   2. In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed rice with 1 1/2 cups of water.
   3. Bring to a boil over high heat, then immediately reduce heat to low.
   4. Cover tightly and simmer for 18 minutes without lifting the lid.
   5. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
   6. Fluff with a fork before cooling.
2. **Cool Rice Safely**
   1. After cooking your rice, spread it evenly on a clean shallow tray or plate to cool it quickly. 
   2. Optionally, place the tray in a cold water bath to hasten cooling or fan the rice while spreading it out to release steam.
   3. Once cooled to near room temperature (preferably within 1 hour), cover and refrigerate until ready to use.
   4. Use this cooled rice to make your fried rice, which helps prevent mushiness and reduces the risk of bacterial growth.
3. **Scramble 2 eggs in a pan with some butter or oil, then set aside.**
4. **Saut√© diced carrots, in butter or oil until tender (about 5 minutes).**
5. **Add the rice, scrambled eggs and soy sauce; stir and fry for 3-5 minutes, letting the rice crisp up a bit.**
6. **Finish with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil, adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, or extra soy sauce.**
7. **Serve hot immediately**
