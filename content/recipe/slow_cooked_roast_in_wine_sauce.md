Reallly like how the wine adds a unique flavor to the roast.  Cranberry juice can be substituted for a similar flavor profile

6 oz per 2 servings

## Ingredients

- 2-3 pounds boneless beef chuck roast
- Kosher or sea salt 
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tablespoons canola oil
- 4 to 6 medium leeks or 2 yellow onions, or 1/2 a sweet onion
- 4 carrots
- 4 red potatoes
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 sprig thyme (or ½ tablespoon)
- 1 sprig rosemary (or ½ tablespoon)
- Potatoes (optional)
- 1 1/2 cups red wine (I used Merlot, any red wine is fine)
- 1 cup low sodium beef broth or water

## Prep Instructions


- Slice leeks: cut off ends and dark green section (see photo below). Then slice the leek in half, lengthwise, place flat side down, and make 1/4-inch slices. Rinse in a salad spinner or bowl of cool water to get out any grit that might be between the layers. If not using leeks, dice an onion.
- Cut ends off carrots and cut into large, 2-3 inch chunks. You don't need to peel them if you don't want, simply give them a rinse and leave them more "rustic". 
- Cut potatoes into quarters
- Prep beef broth

## Instructions

1. Prep Crock Pot, but do not start yet.
1. Pat beef dry and season all over with salt and pepper. 
1. Heat 2 tbsp grapeseed oil in an heavy pot over moderately high heat until hot -- but not smoking -- and brown beef on the top and bottom, about 4-5 minutes on each side. You'll know it's ready to flip when the beef pulls away easily from the bottom of the pan, meaning it has formed a flavorful crust. 
1. Transfer beef to a plate.
1. Add sliced leeks or onion the to pot and sauté over medium heat, stirring frequently, until they soften, about 5 minutes.
1. Add the carrots and salt, saute for another 2-3 minutes.
1. Add potatoes and saute for another 1-2 minutes.
1. Add tomato paste, thyme, rosemary, another pinch of salt and pepper and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. The tomato paste helps enhance the meaty flavor in the whole dish. 
1. Add wine and broth and bring to a boil.
1. Transfer contents of pan to Crock pot (note - can also refigerate overnight, then start in morning)
1. Add beef to crock pot on top of the vegetables -- the liquid should go halfway up the roast. If not, add more water or broth.
1. Set the crock pot to low, and leave for 8-12 hours.
1. Let beef stand, uncovered, in sauce about 30 minutes.
1. Serve. Or shred half of the beef two forks to save for the most amazing tasting leftovers ever. Hello, shredded beef for tacos!
