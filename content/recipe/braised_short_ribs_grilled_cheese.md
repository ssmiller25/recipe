A decadent grilled cheese that transforms leftover braised short ribs into an incredible sandwich. The rich, tender meat pairs perfectly with melted cheese on thick, sturdy bread.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups shredded braised short rib meat [^1]
- 1/2 cup braising liquid/sauce
- 8 slices thick-cut bread (Texas toast, sourdough, or Italian bread) [^2]
- 8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, sliced or shredded
- 4 ounces gruyère or fontina cheese, sliced
- 4 tablespoons butter, softened
- 1 tablespoon Dijon mustard (optional)
- Caramelized onions from the braise (optional)

## Instructions

1. **Prep the short ribs.** Remove the short rib meat from the bones if not already done. Shred or chop into bite-sized pieces. Warm the meat gently with a few tablespoons of the braising liquid in a small pan over low heat until heated through.
2. **Prepare the bread.** Butter one side of each bread slice generously. If using mustard, spread a thin layer on the unbuttered side of 4 slices.
3. **Assemble the sandwiches.** Place 4 bread slices butter-side down. Layer each with:
   - Half the cheddar cheese
   - 1/2 cup warm short rib meat
   - A spoonful of caramelized onions (if using)
   - The gruyère or fontina cheese
   - Remaining cheddar cheese
   - Top with second bread slice, butter-side up
4. **Grill the sandwiches.** Heat a large skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Place sandwiches in the pan and cook for 4-5 minutes per side, pressing gently with a spatula, until golden brown and cheese is melted. [^3]
5. **Rest and serve.** Let sandwiches rest for 2 minutes before cutting in half. Serve with remaining warmed braising liquid on the side for dipping.

## Source/Story

A delicious way to use leftover braised short ribs, inspired by the need to transform a fancy dinner into an amazing sandwich. The thick bread is essential to soak up the rich juices without falling apart.

## Notes

[^1]: Use meat from the [Braised Short Ribs]({{< ref "braised_short_ribs.md" >}}) or [Red Wine-Braised Short Ribs]({{< ref "red_wine_braised_short_ribs.md" >}}) recipes. This is an excellent way to use leftovers or the second half of a batch.
[^2]: Thick bread is crucial here! Regular sandwich bread will get soggy from the juices. Look for bread that's at least 3/4-inch thick. Texas toast, thick-cut sourdough, or Italian bread work perfectly.
[^3]: Low and slow is key - if the heat is too high, the bread will burn before the cheese melts and the filling warms through. Cover with a lid for the last minute if needed to ensure the cheese melts completely.
