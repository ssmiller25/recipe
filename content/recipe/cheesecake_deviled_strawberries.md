## Ingredients

- 18-24 large strawberries
- 1 cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 (8 ounce) package of cream cheese (softened)
- 1/3 cup sour cream
- 2/3 cup white granulated sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice (optional)
- 1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs

## Instructions

1. Prep the strawberries by cutting off the stems and slicing them in half. 
2. Next, cut a small sliver off of the back of each strawberry half so that they sit up straight.
3. Use a small melon baller to carefully hollow out the middle (you don’t need to take out much, just make a small enough indent so that the cream cheese filling doesn’t slide off).
4. In a medium sized mixing bowl, beat the whipping cream until stiff peaks form (about 5 minutes).

5. In a separate bowl, mix together the softened cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, vanilla extract, and lemon juice with an electric mixer until smooth.
6. Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture until well incorporated.
7. Fill a piping bag with the cream cheese mixture (I used a star tip), and pipe it onto each sliced strawberry.
8. Finish with a sprinkle of graham cracker crumbs.
9. Serve and enjoy!
