## Ingredients

- 12 oz Potatoes
- 1 tsp Dried Oregano
- 1 Clover Garlic
- 1 Lemon
- 1 Tomato
- 4 Tbsp Mayonnaise
- 2 Tsp Dijon Mustard
- 2.5 oz Spinach
- 2 Tbsp Cream Cheese
- 4 Slices Sourdough Bread
- 1/2 Cup Feta Cheese
- 1/2 Cup Mozzarella Cheese

## Instructions

1. Roast Potatoes
    - Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry produce.
    - Cut potatoes into 1‚ÅÑ2-inch-thick wedges. Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Roast on top rack until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.
2. Prep
    - While potatoes roast, peel and mince or grate garlic. Quarter lemon. Thinly slice tomato into rounds and season with salt and pepper.
3. Make Dijonnaise
    - In a small bowl, combine mayonnaise, mustard, 1/4 tsp sugar, juice from one lemon wedge, and a pinch of garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Cook Spinach
    - Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add spinach and remaining garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until spinach is wilted, 2-3 minutes.
    - Turn off heat. Transfer spinach to a second small bowl; stir in cream cheese until combined.
    - Wipe out pan.
5. Assumble Sandwiches
    - Spread half the sourdough slices with creamy spinach; top with even layers of feta, mozzarella, and tomato.
    - Spread remaining sourdough slices with Dijonnaise (save some for serving).
    - Close sandwiches.
6. Toast Sandwiches
    - Melt 1 Tbsp butter in pan used for spinach over medium heat. Once hot, add sandwiches and push around in pan until melted butter has absorbed. Cook until bread is golden brown and cheese is slightly melted, 4-6 minutes.
    - Add another 1 Tbsp butter to pan, then flip sandwiches and push around again until melted butter has absorbed. Cook until bread is golden brown and cheese is fully melted, 4-6 minutes. Press down with a heavy pan for a panini experience
7. Finish and Serve
    - Squeeze one lemon wedge over potatoes.
    - Halve panini on a diagonal and divide between plates. Serve with potato wedges and remaining Dijonnaise on the side for dipping.
