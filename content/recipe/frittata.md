Great to add random vegetables too

## Ingredients

- 1 shallot (or 1/2 medium onion or a few cloves of garlic)
- 1 tbsp (~15 ml) extra virgin olive oil
- 1-2 cups (~100 g) baby spinach (or any other leafy green)
- Sea salt or kosher salt
- Freshly ground pepper
- 3 large eggs

Prep


- Peel and cut the shallots into thin slices.  Can be done up to 5 days in advance if kept in the fridge in a sealed plastic bag or airtight container.
- Slice any other veggies you may be tossing in this dish.

## Cook

1. Set oven to "broil"”" function. ("Grill" in Europe. If there is no broil or grill function, put it to the highest setting 500 F / 260 C).
1. Heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat.
1. Add shallots and stir occasionally until soft, about 1-2 minutes.
1. Add the baby spinach and stir until wilted, about 1 minute.
1. Crack eggs into a medium bowl, add a pinch of salt and pepper.  Whisk with a fork until smooth.
1. Pour egg mixture over the veggies in the skillet. Lift pan and swirl the mixture so it spreads out evenly in the pan.
1. Cook over low heat until eggs are set on the bottom (when you shake the pan, the whole thing should move). Keep gently pulling the sides of the frittata away from the edge of the skillet with a spatula so they don’t stick.
1. Transfer to the oven under the broiler to set the top and get it nice and golden brown, it could be anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes depending on how hot your oven is.  Keep an eye on it so it doesn’t burn.
1. Remove from oven and let cool.  Slice up into slices and serve. Or store in airtight container for up to 3-4 days.  Perfect for breakfast, lunch, or dinner with a side of mixed salad greens!


## Variation Ideas
- Add any other raw vegetables and cook until tender before adding the egg mixture: sliced bell peppers, zucchini (courgettes), tomatoes, asparagus, leeks, fennel, squash
- Add leftover-precooked vegetables like potatoes or kale and heat through before adding the egg mixture
- Add chopped fresh herbs or grated cheese to the egg mixture before pouring over veggies
