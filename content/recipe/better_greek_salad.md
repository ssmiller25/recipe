## Ingredients

- 5 large tomatoes
- 1 small red onion, thinly sliced
- sea salt to taste
- 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano
- 1 small green bell pepper, sliced (Optional)
- 1/2 medium cucumber, sliced (Optional)
- 1/4 cup Greek black olives
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
- 1 (8 ounce) package feta cheese

## Instructions

1. Cut tomatoes into wedges over a large serving bowl so that any extra juices land in the bowl with tomato wedges. Add onion slices and oregano, then season liberally with salt; mix to combine. Allow tomatoes **to sit at room temperature until juices have released**, at least 20 to 30 minutes or up to 2 hours.
2. Mix in bell pepper, cucumber, and olives just before serving. Top with feta cheese and drizzle with olive oil.

## Tips

Don't skip the salting and resting step! The tomatoes' acidic juices combine with the olive oil to make the perfect dressing, with no need to add vinegar or lemon juice at the end. To encourage the juices to release, give the tomatoes an occasional stir while resting.
