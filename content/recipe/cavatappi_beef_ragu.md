## Ingredients

- 1 Carrot
- 1/4 oz Parsley
- 6 oz Cavatappi Pasta
- 1 lb Ground Beef
- 1 Tbsp [Italian Seasoning](/recipe/spice_blends)
- 14 oz Marinara Sauce
- 2 Tbsp Cream Cheese
- 3 Tbsp Parmesan Cheese

## Instructions

1. Prep
    - Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce.
    - Trim, peel, and finely chop carrot. Pick parsley leaves from stems; roughly chop leaves.
2. Cook Pasta
    - Once water is boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes. Drain.
3. Cook Carrot
    - While cavatappi cooks, heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add carrot; cook, stirring, until browned and tender, 6-8 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Cook Beef
    - Increase heat under pan with carrot to medium high and add a drizzle of oil. Push carrot to one side of pan.
    - Add beef to empty side. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned, 4-6 minutes. Sprinkle with Italian Seasoning. Cook, stirring, until beef is cooked through, 4-6 minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper.
    - Stir carrot and beef to combine.
5. Finish Sauce
    - Stir in marinara and 1/3 cup water. Reduce to a simmer and cook until sauce has slightly thickened, 3-4 minutes. Reduce heat to low.
    - Stir in cream cheese until thoroughly combined.
    - Add drained cavatappi, half the chopped parsley, and 1 Tbsp butter; stir until pasta is warmed through, 1-2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
6. Serve
    - Divide pasta between plates or bowls. Top with Parmesan and remaining chopped parsley. Serve.
