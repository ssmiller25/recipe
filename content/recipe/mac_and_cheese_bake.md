## Ingredients

- 1 Long Green Pepper
- 1 Tomato
- 1 Clove Garlic
- 6 oz Cavatappi Pasta
- 1/2 Cup Panko Breadcrumbs
- 8 oz Heavy Cream + 1/2 tsp Carlic Powder (Replease Cream Sauce Base)
- 2 Tbsp Cream Cheese
- 1/2 Cup White Cheddar Cheese
- 1/4 Cup Monterey Jack Cheese
- 1/2 Cup Mexican Cheese Blend

## Instructions

1. Prep
    - Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Bring a medium pot  of salted water to a boil. Wash and dry produce.
    - Halve green pepper lengthwise; remove stem and seeds. Dice tomato. Peel garlic clove and place in the center of a small piece of foil; drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Cinch into a packet.
2. Roast Veggies
    - Place green pepper halves, cut sides down, on a baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil; season with salt and pepper. Place garlic foil packet on same sheet.
    - Roast on top rack until green pepper is tender and lightly blistered and garlic is softened, 15-17 minutes.
    - Remove from oven. Once cool enough to handle, transfer everything to a cutting board. Dice green pepper. Mash garlic with a fork.
    - Heat broiler to high or heat oven to 500 degrees.
3. Cook Pasta and Make Toppings
    - Once water is boiling, add cavatappi to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente, 9-11 minutes.
    - Reserve 3/4 cup pasta cooking water, then drain.
    - Meanwhile, place 1 TBSP butter in a small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until melted, 30 seconds. Stir in panko. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Make Sauce
    - Heat empty pot used for pasta over medium heat. Add cream sauce base and cream cheese; bring to a simmer, whisking, until smooth, 1-2 minutes.
    - Reduce heat to low and whisk in white cheddar, Monterey Jack, and Mexican cheese blend until melted and smooth.
5. Mix Mac and Cheese
    - Stir drained cavatappi, mashed garlic, diced green pepper, and tomato into pot with cheese sauce. If needed, stir in reserved pasta cooking water a splash at a time until cavatappi is coated in a creamy sauce. Taste and season with salt and pepper if necessary.
6. Finish and Serve
    - Transfer mac & cheese to an 8-by-8- inch baking dish. Sprinkle with seasoned panko; broil or bake until panko is browned and crispy, 2-3 minutes. **Watch carefully to avoid burning.**
    - Divide between plates or serve directly from baking dish.
