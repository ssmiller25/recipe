## Ingredients

- Pasta, any pasta, we’re using linguine, 4 oz (fetticcini, 8/29)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- salt
- 1/2 bunch asparagus
- 1 small zucchini
- 1/2 can diced tomatoes
- 1/4 cup chicken broth
- Small bunch of fresh basil or parsley, optional
- 2 chicken breasts

## Prep

- Peel garlic cloves. If you LOVE garlic flavor, mince it too. The smaller the garlic is cut, the more garlic flavor will get into the dish. 
- Snap off ends of asparagus and slice into 2-inch pieces
- Cut zucchini in half lengthwise, place cut side down and slice thinly.
- Make the broiled chicken, slice into strips.
    - Preheat Broiler
    - Unthaw frozen, brined chicken breasts
    - Place chicken on baking sheet covered with Aluminum foil
    - Sprinkle with Pepper and spice mix, if desired
    - Broil for 5 minutes, flip, then another 5 minutes.
    - Take out and rest for 5 minutes.


## Instructions

1. Bring a large pot of heavily salted water to a boil. Cook pasta according to package directions, taking 1 minute off the recommended cooking time.
1. Heat oil in a large saute pan or skillet over medium heat.
1. Add the peeled garlic cloves.
1. Cook garlic until golden brown, stirring occasionally, about 3-5 minutes. If using minced garlic, cook for only 30 seconds so it doesn't burn. 
1. Add the asparagus, zucchini, and pinch of salt.
1. Cook for two minutes, stirring occasionally.
1. Add can of diced tomatoes with its juices and a pinch of salt.
1. Stir for 1 minute.
1. Add broth, stir.
1. Cover pot for 3-5 minutes until veggies are crisp-tender, meaning you can easily pierce them with a fork.
1. When pasta is ready, scoop out ½ cup of the pasta water first with a cup, then drain the rest in a colander. Don't worry if you forget this part, I do it all the time! It will still taste great, promise. 
1. Add the pasta to the pan of veggies along with the cup of your reserved pasta cooking water.
1. Stir to combine.
1. Taste, and adjust the salt, and taste again. I find that this dish, especially with the canned diced tomatoes, needs more salt that you’d think in order to bring out the natural flavors in the ingredients. So keep tasting, stirring, and adding a small pinch of salt until the flavors pop. 
1. Serve topped with broiled chicken breasts (or tofu) and a sprinkle of fresh herbs or hot pepper flakes if you’d like!
