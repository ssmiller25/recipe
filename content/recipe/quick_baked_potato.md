## Ingredients

- 1 medium potato (russet or Yukon gold works best)

## Instructions

1. Prepare the potato
   1. Wash and scrub the potato under cold running water to remove dirt
   2. Prick the potato all over with a fork 6-8 times to allow steam to escape and prevent bursting
2. Microwave the potato
   1. Place the pricked potato on a microwave-safe plate
   2. Microwave on high for 5-10 minutes (depending on size), flipping halfway through
   3. Check for doneness by piercing with a fork - it should slide through easily
3. (Optional) Crisp in the air fryer
   1. Preheat the air fryer to 400°F (200°C)
   2. Lightly oil the potato skin and air fry for 5-8 minutes until the skin is crisp
4. Cool and serve
   1. Let the potato cool for 1-2 minutes before handling
   2. Cut open lengthwise and fluff the insides with a fork

## Notes

- Make multiple potatoes at once by adding 2-3 minutes per additional potato
- Pierce generously to prevent the potato from exploding in the microwave
